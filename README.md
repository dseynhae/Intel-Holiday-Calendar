   1. Go to <https://outlook.office.com/calendar/view/week>.
   2. Click on `Add Calendar`.
   3. Select `Subscribe from web` tab.
   4. Provide URL, provide details.

      ```url
      https://github.com/dseynhae/Intel-Holiday-Calendar/blob/main/Intel-Holidays-UNITED-STATES.ics
      ```

   5. Import, close `Add Calendar` popup.

   ⚠️ A web calendar needs to be accessible from a public URL.

* This will NOT work when using a 1Source Sandbox repository (the URL is still internal)!
* The source URL (<http://phonebook.intel.com/cgi-bin/phonecal?e=>) also won't work;
    Therefore, the different region calendars are copied from this internal location, to the WAN-accessible URL in GitHub.

This repository holds all the components to make this happen.
